# Replication-of-Papagno-et-al.-1991-Kor-ver
A simple replication experiment of the experiment 1 from Papagno et al. (1991) in Korean version. I conducted this experiment for my term paper. Technically speaking, it's not fully conducted replication experiment since the number of the participants in this experiment is lower than the one in Papagno et al. (1991).

However, for me, it's one of the funniest and most interesting experiment that I've done. Simple and neat.
